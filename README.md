# Watts-Repo
Repository for Code Louisville Project / Alan Watts quote generator

This project is a website that features a quote generator that turns out quotes from a favorite self-attested philosophical "entertainer" of mine, Alan Watts.
Aside from the quote generator itself when content gets filled in this would be ideally a website that gives a rounded introduction into his work and why it could be considered
important, ranging from influences on popular culture (influenced the creators of South Park, Bruce Lee, Van Morrison and more) to influences in philosophy etc. A bibliography page
is added with a list of some of his more popular books, and a signup form for a fictional newsletter that filters by related topics is included (styling yet to come at this time).

CSS Features included:

1.A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item
 
 -Currently included on both the main and bibliography pages
  
2.Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop
 
 -Currently featured on the main page only
  
3.Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table 
  
  -Featured in the bibliography page, used to divide the list of books through styling as if unable to edit the list of books in html. Currently setup with a series of divs that
  are styled such that the books are divided up into 3 separate groups.
 
Javascript Feature included:

4.Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents on your page
  
  -Featured with the quote generator on the main page.
